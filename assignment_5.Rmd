### **1. Introduction**

The Pacific Giant Salamander (*Dicamptodon tenebrosus*) is one of Oregon's largest native amphibians (Oregon Wild). They are typically the dominant vertebrate predator in high gradient streams and an indicator species of healthy waterways (Parker 1994). This amphibian is dependent on clean aquatic habitats for survival; however, logging and other human activities can severely affect their stream habitats (Oregon Wild). This report will explore the abundance and weight of giant salamander populations in two forest sections (clear cut and old growth) of Mack Creek in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. This data was collected by Stanley Gregory from 1993 to 2017, which is one of the longest continuous records of salmonid populations (Gregory S.V. 2016). Here, we use the data to explore relationships between salamander abundance and weight in several sections and channels of the creek.

### **2. Data and Methods**

Data for Pacific Giant Salamander abundance, weight, and location from 1993-2017 was collected by [Stanley V. Gregory](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-and&identifier=4027&revision=12). Salamander counts (individuals) were based on the number of observations made in each section every year. Each salamander captured at Mack Creek was measured and weighed. Salamanders were observed in three different channel classifications: “pool”, “cascade”, and “side-channel”, and in two types of forest sections: “clear-cut” and “old-growth”. Salamander abundances were compared for each forest section by graphing trends between surveys in 1993 and 2017. A chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of salamander counts in each channel classification for both forest sections. Trends in salamander weights in different forest conditions were compared by two-sample t-tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Salamander weights across the three channel classifications were compared using one-way ANOVA tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Figure 4 shows that all three channel types have outliers, which could potentially have skewed the means. Further analysis using a non-parametric comparison test may need to be conducted to compare the medians of the three samples. All analyses and figures were developed through R software version 1.2.1335.

### **3. Results**


#### *Results A - Pacific Salamander abundances*
```{r}
# Read in "mack_creek_vertebrate.csv" and tidy data
salamander_data <- read_csv("mack_creek_vertebrates.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(species == "DITE")

salamander_data$section[salamander_data$section == "OG"] <- "Old Growth"

salamander_data$unittype[salamander_data$unittype == "C"] <- "Cascade"
salamander_data$unittype[salamander_data$unittype =="SC"] <- "Side-channel"
salamander_data$unittype[salamander_data$unittype == "P"] <- "Pool"


```

```{r}
# Tidy data and record salamander counts per section

        legend.key.width = unit(5, "mm")) +

       subtitle = "Source: Gregory S.V. 2016",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Salamander Count",

```

Salamander counts were highest for both sections of the forest between 2003-2010. The old growth section of the forest typically had higher counts of salamanders than the clear cut sections except for the years 2015-2017. However, it appears from Figure 3 that general trends in salamander abundance are similar in both sections of forest from 1993 to 2017.

#### *Results B - 2017 counts and proportions*

```{r}
# create table of salamnder counts for different channel types by forest section for 2017
salamander_2017 <- salamander_data %>% 
  filter(year == "2017", 
         unittype %in% c("Cascade","Side-channel","Pool")) %>%
  mutate(Section = section) %>% 
  count(Section, unittype)

salamander_2017_table <- salamander_2017 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = unittype, values_from = n)

# add proportions to table
salamander_2017_props <- salamander_2017_table %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

salamander_2017_props %>% 
  kable(digits = 2,
        caption = "Table 1. Salamander counts observed at three channel types in Mack Creek for clear-cut and old-growth forest sections in 2017. Values indicated are counts, with proportions (by channel type) in parenthesis. Data Source: Aquatic Vertebrate Population Study in Mack Creek (2017)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left") %>% 
  add_header_above(c("", "Channel Type" = 3))

```

#### *Results C - Chi-square test*

```{r}
# perform chi square test of salamnder 2017 counts
salamander_2017_chi_counts <- salamander_2017_table %>% 
  select(-Section)

salamander_2017_chi <- chisq.test(salamander_2017_chi_counts)

```

There is not a significant association between forest condition (old-growth or clear-cut) and where salamanders are most often observed in the creek channel. Counts and proportions (Table 1) of salamanders by channel characteristic in clear-cut forest are independent from old-growth forest ($\chi$^2^(`r salamander_2017_chi$parameter`) = `r round(salamander_2017_chi$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(salamander_2017_chi$p.value, 2)`). Most salamanders are found in the "cascade" channel type and the fewest salamanders are found in the "pool" channel type regardless of whether it's located in a clear-cut or old-growth section of the forest. 

#### *Results D - Salamander weights between forest sections in 2017*

```{r}
# Perform 2 sample t-tests for 2017 old-growth and 2017 clear-cut sections

salamander_compare <- salamander_data %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(year, section, weight)

salamander_summary <- salamander_compare %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()) 

# summary table of salamander weight statistics 
salamander_summary %>% 
  kable(digits = 2,
        caption = "Table 2. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and number of counts) of Pacific salamander weights by forest section in Mack Creek in 2017.",
        col.names = c("Forest Section",
                      "Mean Weight (g)",
                      "Standard Deviation (g)",
                      "Count")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

# Create Vectors
clear_cut <- salamander_data %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  filter(section == "Clear Cut") %>% 
  pull(weight)

old_growth <- salamander_data %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  filter(section == "Old Growth") %>% 
  pull(weight)

# Perform T-test and cohen's d comparing clear-cut and old-growth sections in 2017
salamander_section_ttest <- t.test(clear_cut, old_growth, na.rm = TRUE)

# Perform cohen's d test

salamander_section_d <- cohen.d(clear_cut, old_growth, na.rm = TRUE)

```
The mean salamander weights in clear-cut (`r round(salamander_section_ttest$estimate[1], 2)` g) and old growth (`r round(salamander_section_ttest$estimate[2], 2)` g) forest sections are similar to each other, with only a difference of 1.2 g between them. Statistical analysis confirms that there is no significant difference (t(`r round(salamander_section_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(salamander_section_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(salamander_section_ttest$p.value, 2)`)) between the mean weights of salamanders located in clear-cut and old-growth forest sections. A neglible effect size (Cohen's d = `r round(salamander_section_d$estimate, 3)`) indicates that there is almost no discernible difference in mean weights between the two forest sections of Mack Creek. 

#### *Results E - Salamander weights between channel types in 2017*

```

```{r}
salamander_aov <- aov(weight~unittype, data = salamander_weight) 
aov_outputs <- unlist(summary(salamander_aov))
```

The mean salamander weights in each channel type (Cascade, Pool, and Side-channel) of Mack Creek are summarized in Table 3. Salamanders found in pools had the highest mean weight (`r round(sal_weight_summary$mean_sal_weight[2], 2)` g, n = `r sal_weight_summary$sample_size[2]`), compared to those found in cascades (`r round(sal_weight_summary$mean_sal_weight[1], 2)` g, n = `r sal_weight_summary$sample_size[1]`), and side-channels (`r round(sal_weight_summary$mean_sal_weight[3], 2)` g, n = `r sal_weight_summary$sample_size[3]`), which had the lowest mean weight. The one-way ANOVA test determined that there is a significant difference between at least two of the three channel type mean weights (F(`r aov_outputs[1]`, `r aov_outputs[2]`) = `r round(aov_outputs[7], 2)`, *p* = `r round(aov_outputs[9], 2)`). It is unknown which two of the three channel types have stastically different means, so further analysis with a post-hoc pairwise test like Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences will be needed. 

In addition, Figure 4 shows that for each of the channel types there are outliers in weight that may be skewing the means. A majority of the weight observations are within the range of 0 to 20 grams, but there are values for each channel type that are above 50 grams. Because of this data skew, it may not be the best to compare the sample means across channel types. Instead, it would be better to use either a non-parametric comparison test or a test that compares median weights. 

### **Summary**

The results from the statistical analysis of Pacific salamander abundances and weights in Mack Creek, Oregon are as follows:

- The abundances of Pacific salamanders have showed similar trends between old-growth and clear-cut forest sections from 1993 to 2017 (Figure 3).
- There is not a significant association between forest condition (old-growth or clear-cut) and the channel type (cascade, pool, and side-channel) in which salamanders are more abundant. Proportions of salamander counts in each channel type are similar in clear-cut and old-growth forest sections (Table 1).
- In addition, there is no significant difference between means of salamander weight in clear cut and old growth forest sections. 
- Between the three channel types, at least two of the mean salamander weights are not equal. Additional testing is required to determine which of the two are different. Mean data may be skewed by outliers, so it is recommended that future testing compare median values of salamander weight (Figure 4)
